# Parameters for CFRP Simulation
Python scripts in order to successfully simulate progressive damage of carbon fiber reinforced polymers.

In my master thesis, I simulated temperature dependent progressive damage in Abaqus 2017. The foundation was the Nasa CompDam_DGD and I expanded the script by adding a module that recalculated mechanical properties based on the operating temperature.

For a successful simulation, two processes had to be accomplished.

1. Transform temperature dependent results of real mechanical tests into a sufficient mathematical equation and implement it into the CompDam Code.

2. Create a CFRP-model in Abaqus that fulfills the requirements of the CompDAm Code.
