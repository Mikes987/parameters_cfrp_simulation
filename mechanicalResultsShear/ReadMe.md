# Mechanical Results of Shear tests of CFRP according to operating temperature

These txt files represent raw data of temperature dependent 12-shear tests of CFRP at Hamburg University of Technology.

As one can observe, there are no units or descriptions within these txt-files, so these columns represent:

1. Shear strain in first column without units.
2. Shear stress in MPa in second column.
